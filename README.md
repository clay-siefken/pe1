Solutions for Project Euler Problem #1 in many programming languages

# Background

Project Euler is a site for solving increasingly-challenging math and computer science problems for the purpose of entertainment and learning. I used to enjoy solving PE problems regularly many years ago, way before becoming a dad and a corporate working stiff. One challenge I set for myself was to stay aware of programming languages, new and old, and be able to use them in a basic, practical sense. To demonstrate this ability to myself, I began solving the first PE problem in every language I could lay my hands on. For many of the more popular languages, I repeated this process in other PE problems to gain a more in-depth appreciation for these languages. But. It's actually much funner to experience the productive frustration and novel weirdness of strange nichey languages. So I went further with PE1.

I have decided to publish these files as an open source repo because it's fun and maybe helpful and these files will rot in my Dropbox otherwise. I figure that PE1 is trivial enough that no harm is done by showing the solution to that problem (which can be just as easily solve using pencil-and-paper or a spreadsheet in minutes) compared to the later ones.
