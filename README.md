# pe1
Solutions for Project Euler Problem #1 in many programming languages

# Background

Project Euler is a site for solving increasingly-challenging math and computer science problems for the purpose of entertainment and learning. I used to enjoy solving PE problems regularly many years ago, way before becoming a dad and a corporate working stiff. One challenge I set for myself was to stay aware of programming languages, new and old, and be able to use them in a basic, practical sense. To demonstrate this ability to myself, I began solving the first PE problem in every language I could lay my hands on. For many of the more popular languages, I repeated this process in other PE problems to gain a more in-depth appreciation for these languages. But. It's actually much funner to experience the productive frustration and novel weirdness of strange nichey languages. So I went further with PE1.

I have decided to publish these files as an open source repo because it's fun and maybe helpful and these files will rot in my Dropbox otherwise. I figure that PE1 is trivial enough that no harm is done by showing the solution to that problem (which can be just as easily solve using pencil-and-paper or a spreadsheet in minutes) compared to the later ones.

# Note
At the time I was writing these, this was only for fun. I may have referenced code from forums or tutorials to create them. If you identify any improperly derived copyrightable code, please just let me know and I'll remove the offending work. Thanks!
