# Language Template

This document outlines how each language added to this repository should be 
documented.

# Folder Structure

* Language Folder - use the name of the language as the folder name under src
  * README.md - this is a markdown file with a structure outlined below
  * Other files - all other files should be placed in language folder's root

# Language README.md

The document should have these sections / answer these questions:

* What is this language called? Where can I go to learn about it generally?
* What are the instructions for working with this file? How do I run it?
* Are there any "gotchas" or "quirks" working with the file or the language?
